# IN DETAIL

1. Make use of the existing UI design patterns. As a developer you got to reach out to existing 
   design patterns out there. There are sites with collection of various design patterns that can
   be referred to and among them include pttrns.com and uigarage.net. These have most common reusable and 
   good design pattens one could borrow design knowledge.

2. Training your eye to design. Making your eye get close to various designs that inspire you. The bad 
   and good designs all add up to dsigner creativity as they motivate one to think what if you changed 
   here or the other side. As well, you could make your most inspirational designers to be on your 
   mind full time, possibly by folowing them via their social platforms and subscribing to their news
   letters.

3. Network Nigga ! Why not move to that event close to you whose agaenda centers on design. Its highly 
   important for freelancing designers and individuals who are one on teams of developers. You coud gain
   what could define you through out your career. Try it Out Boss ! You will be able to discuss the common
   issues to your design issues together with great or senior designers.

4. Copy senior designers. Yes, copy them. Look at that beautiful work of your senior counterparts. Do not
   reverse engineer, men ! Please sit down and try to recreate that Guy's work. The creativity you come up
   with while trying out the halla with transform you not leaving you the same.

5. Take on imaginary small projects. As beginner like me, why not tkae on those small design projects you
   think they can tickle down your design ego. What do you think in your mind when you remember about school
   sites. Recreate one and see the design you can come up with, yo can stat with my portifolio and share 
   link with me via cleverarinda@gmail.com

6. Share your work (and ask for feedback). From the portifolio you have designed for me, let me have a
   look and I will robably get you feedback on the layout, widgets and color choice. Share your design 
   works with colleagues and let them say something. What do you think about their feedback ?

7. Find a mentor among your inspirational designers, great developers and good system analysts. They will 
   possibly guide you on how to move on with the design thing. You are going to be a great designer and your
   works will be great, men.

   Thank you and Regards !!
